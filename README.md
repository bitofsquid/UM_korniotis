Over the last few months, I have been conducting research alongside Dr. George Korniotis (http://bit.ly/2d6gd6f) exploring relationships between state level economic data releases and local stock returns. In research previously published by Dr. Korniotis and colleagues[1], a link was found that state economic data releases tend to impact local stock returns. Specifically, the study finds that "local stock prices decline and average future returns...rise during local recessions as local risk aversion increases and local risk sharing abilities decline." The work that I had been involved in focused on refining these findings in an attempt to formulate potential trading strategies to capitalize on this phenomenon.

The R script within this repo gathers and formats data from the Beareau of Economic Analysis and the Beaureau of Labor Statistics. Most of the data was gathered and formatted programmatically in R, however, there were portions that were done manually in Microsoft Excel (e.g. I opted to gather release times and dates manually due to my rather modest webscraping abilities).
